<<< BAN for IP address >>>

Ban4IP reads log file containing failure report, and ban these IP addresses using iptables.

Ban4IP is supported IPv4 and IPv6 address.

For a long time, everyone has been waiting for this tool? like fail2ban. :-)

To all of the administrators and IPv4 and IPv6 users.


Need Package:

    php
    php-devel
    php-pear
    php-mbstring
    php-pdo (SQLite3)
    php-process
    php-inotify
    procps


Usage:

Step0. Install (e.g. CentOS7)

yum -y install php php-devel php-pear php-mbstring php-pdo php-process php-pecl-inotify

wget 'https://github.com/disco-v8/Ban4ip/archive/master.zip' -O Ban4ip-master.zip
unzip ./Ban4ip-master.zip

cd ./Ban4ip-master/

chmod 700 ./ban4ipd
chmod 700 ./ban4ipc
chmod 755 ./init.d/ban4ip

mkdir /etc/ban4ip/
mkdir /var/lib/ban4ip/

cp ./ban4ipd.conf /etc/
cp ./ban4ip/* /etc/ban4ip/

cp ./ban4ipc /usr/bin/
cp ./ban4ipd /usr/bin/
cp ./ban4ipd_*.php /usr/bin/

cp ./logrotate.d/ban4ip /etc/logrotate.d/

cp ./init.d/ban4ip /etc/init.d/
chkconfig --add ban4ip


Step1. Edit ban4ipd.conf and Sub-config file.

ban4ipd.conf...

YOU CAN UNDERSTAND CONFIG, IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF THIS TOOL. :-)

Sub-config file...
-------------------------------
    :
    :
target_service = 'apache-error'            ... only affects log message.
target_log = '/var/log/httpd/error_log'    ... name of log file.
target_protcol = 'tcp'                     ... BAN protcol. (tcp, udp, all)
target_port = 80                           ... BAN port. (nnn or all)
target_rule = 'DROP'                       ... BAN packet rule. (DROP, REJECT, LOG)

target_str[] = '/error\] \[client (.*)\] client /'        ... (.) is target of BAN.
    :
    :
-------------------------------

"target_str[]" is array parameter. Please write a regular expression..

If you set 'all' to target_protcol and 'target_port', BAN all access from target IP address.


Step2. Start ban4ipd

ban4ipc start

If you changed Sub-config file...

ban4ipc reload

Or ban4ipd.conf...

ban4ipc restart

If you want to know BANs IP address...

ban4ipc list

Other option...

ban4ipc -h

Have a nice sleep! :-)


Memo:

"Inotify extension not loaded!?", but PECL inotify installed.

 -> pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/inotify-0.x.x (CentOS6)
 -> And, "extension=inotify.so" write in /etc/php.d/inotify.ini

"PHP Fatal error:  Class 'SQLite3' not found in /root/ban4ip/ban4ipd.php on line 330"

 -> You have to install php-pdo (SQLite3) package.
 
"ban4ipd ... Found other process : /var/run/ban4ip.pid!?"

 -> Illegal termination!? rm /var/run/ban4ip.pid.

"PHP Warning:  SQLite3::exec(): database is locked in ..."

 -> It is so heavy?! extend db_timeout's value in ban4ipd.conf.

"The user limit on the total number of inotify instances has been reached"
"Failed to obtain an inotify instance!?"

 -> Sorry, You should reduce config file. (= target log).
