<<< BAN for nftables (Netfilter) >>>

Ban4nft is a lockout tool that reads log files containing fail information and uses nft(nftables) to ban IP addresses that persistently cause failures.

Ban4nft is supported IPv4 and IPv6 address.

Previously, I created a lockout tool called Ban4IP.

One prominent Linux distribution will moving from iptables to nftables, so I created a lockout tool called Ban4nft.

For all server admins and IPv4 & IPv6 users. :-)


Need Package:

    php
    php-devel
    php-pear
    php-mbstring
    php-pdo (SQLite3/PostgreSQL/MySQL)
    php-process
    php-inotify
    procps


Usage:

Step0. Install (e.g.  CentOS 10 Stream)

dnf -y install php php-devel php-pear php-mbstring php-pdo php-process php-pecl-inotify

wget 'https://github.com/disco-v8/Ban4nft/archive/main.zip' -O ban4nft-main.zip
unzip ./package/ban4nft-main.zip

cd ./ban4nft-main/

chmod 700 ./ban4nftd
chmod 700 ./ban4nftc
chmod 755 ./init.d/ban4nft

mkdir /etc/ban4nft/
mkdir /var/lib/ban4nft/

cp ./ban4nftd.conf /etc/
cp ./ban4nft/* /etc/ban4nft/

cp ./ban4nftc /usr/bin/
cp ./ban4nftd /usr/bin/
cp ./ban4nftd_*.php /usr/bin/

cp ./logrotate.d/ban4nft /etc/logrotate.d/

/bin/cp ./systemd/ban4nft.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl --no-pager -l status ban4nft

systemctl enable ban4nft
systemctl --no-pager -l status ban4nft


Step1. Edit ban4nftd.conf and Sub-config file.

ban4nftd.conf...

YOU CAN UNDERSTAND CONFIG, IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF THIS TOOL. :-)

Sub-config file...
-------------------------------
    :
    :
target_service = 'apache-error'            ... only affects log message.
target_log = '/var/log/httpd/error_log'    ... name of log file.
target_protcol = 'tcp'                     ... BAN protcol. (tcp, udp, all)
target_port = 80                           ... BAN port. (nnn or all)
target_rule = 'DROP'                       ... BAN packet rule. (DROP, REJECT, LOG)

target_str[] = '/error\] \[client (.*)\] client /'        ... (.) is target of BAN.
    :
    :
-------------------------------

"target_str[]" is array parameter. Please write a regular expression..

If you set 'all' to target_protcol and 'target_port', BAN all access from target IP address.


Step2. Start Ban4nftd

ban4nftc start

If you changed Sub-config file...

ban4nftc reload

Or ban4nftd.conf...

ban4nftc restart

If you want to know BANs IP address...

ban4nftc list

Other option...

ban4nftc -h

Have a nice sleep! :-)


Memo:

"Inotify extension not loaded!?", but PECL inotify installed.

 -> pecl search inotify
 -> pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/inotify-3.0.0
 -> And, "extension=inotify.so" write in /etc/php.d/inotify.ini

"PHP Fatal error:  Class 'SQLite3' not found in /root/ban4nft/ban4nftd.php on line 330"

 -> You have to install php-pdo (SQLite3) package.
 
"ban4nftd ... Found other process : /var/run/ban4nft.pid!?"

 -> Illegal termination!? rm /var/run/ban4nft.pid.

"PHP Warning:  SQLite3::exec(): database is locked in ..."

 -> It is so heavy?! extend db_timeout's value in ban4nftd.conf.

"The user limit on the total number of inotify instances has been reached"
"Failed to obtain an inotify instance!?"

 -> Sorry, You should reduce config file. (= target log).

"When using PostgreSQL/MySQL..."

  count_db
  ban_db
  mailrate_db

Create the above three databases. (The tables will be created automatically.)
Then rewrite “pdo_dsn_???” in ban4nftd.conf as needed to enable the setting.
If you have multiple servers on which you want to install “Ban4nft,” you can 
share count_db so that all servers can share fail count information,
which will allow you to quickly respond to lockouts.

Do not share ban_db and mailrate_db, as they must be handled on a per-server basis.
